# "Beresheet" SpaceCraft - Moon Landing Simulation

Beresheet was a small robotic lunar lander and lunar probe operated by SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries.
Beresheet was sent on a real space mission - to reach and land the moon, trying to consume the least amount of fuel as possible!

# The Point of no Return

On 11 April 2019, the lander crash-landed on the lunar surface. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU2) gyroscope failed during the braking procedure on approach to the landing site, and the ground control crew was unable to reset the individual component due to a sudden loss of communications with the control network.
